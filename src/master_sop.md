from the childhood, I have tried to minimize my financial dependence on my parents. To achieve that, I have worked hard and smart to get into Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya, A central government boarding school with best academics and curriculum in central government syllabus. later I have got into National Institue of Technology, a central government funded Institue for best engineering studies. Then for my masters in Technology, I have secured seat in IIT Madras. All of these schools and engineering colleges are some of the best in their league along with minimal Fee structure. I strongly happy what I have achieved in my life until now while keeping financial burden on my Parents to a minimal amount.

During and after my bacheler's degree and Master's degree,my main goal was to study well and get a good job to support my family. I have done that very well till now. During my Intermediate studies, I have joined in a college where state government entrance exams was the main concentration. I have not only excelled in that entrance exam(AP-EAMCET) by achieving a rank of 2724 out of 2,76,995 students but also excelled in the national Entrance exam, JEE-MAINS, by securing a rank of 14475 out of 12,80,000 students. I have stretched myself to achieve higher goals than what is presented in front of me. This lead me to study in National Institute of Technology puducherry, one of the better central government funded institutes in India for Engineering. Later with these foundations in Electronics and Communication, I was very interested to do MTech in Micro electronics and VLSI Design. I have appeared in GATE exam where I have got a rank of 347 out of 1,25,870 applicants which got me into Indian Institute of Technology Madras, one of the best institutes(NIRF rank 1) in India.
My goals towards getting best education with low financial burden on my parents lead me to achieve these milestones and which shaped my career till now. I am a goal achiever. I face the struggles, overcome the obstacles, learn from the failure and finally achieve my goals.

Along my journey, my goals are intended for the betterment of me and my family. Now I have a goal that makes the lives of me, my family and the world better. I would love to work towards achieving that. And as I am fully dedicated towards my vision.

* I know for a fact that while you want to do a planned task/work. The most simple but best solution is to just do it instead of thinking so many preparatory works and further planning.


# Help got from others
Even though I have a very good career, this was not completely self made. I have had help from my family and friend throughout my journey who made me to walk through the right path when I was deviating. My mother, among all, is the main reason why I am still here. After my JEE-MAINS results, she is the one who told me to apply for more colleges than the top 3 colleges. Because I got her advise and actully followed that, I had this nice journey in my life and that particular advise brought me here. That is power of advise coming from great people and great mentors and advisors which is the reason I have to study at Stanford, a place where collaoration is the in built within the culture, a place where great minds and visionaries come together.

To be a part of such community not only is a blessing to me but I should also provide the same benefits to my peers. As we say trust is a two way street so does the relationships, collaborations, knowledge sharing among peers at Stanford. I am looking forward to shape my future at one of the best MBA schools in the world to shape the future of the world and my country India.

# Path that lead to Entreprenership and MBA:
Starting from Watching Tech related/science fiction movies to TV shows which lead me to watch Youtube tech reviews that made me to be an tech reviewer. This lead me to think what I actually desire which is to have financial independence so that I and my family don't have to struggle through financial issues and crisis and then work on my values and ideas that can provide huge value to the world, contribute hugely to Indian and worldwide economy.
The thought to achieve financial independence was to have a part time work afte my full time job timings. The part time job ideas have pivoted a lot based on lot of research on how much time to achive my goals, what are the efforts needed etc. So it started with Youtube tech reviewer to Tech article writer to Software development.
When I reached software development as the idea to pursue in my free time, that enlightened me of my skill I have gained while working as Associate software engineer.
This made me to work on software development.

As I started working on Software development, my continuous thinking on this opened up my mind to see the world in a different perspective. Constant and continuation thinking avout software ideas gave me to research the market which lead me to broaden my  knowledge on the modern tech being build in the SaaS market.
The closed postive feedback loop between ideas, exploration and market reesearch made me understand the values of my ideas and hope for my future in this field.
For each idea, This positive feedback gave me to understand this product market fit, explore and trigger new ideas. after  such continuous effort, right now I am working on the initial steps of finding the market needs for an idea which is a result of this continous effort from my last 10 months. Just Ideas are not enough for success. so parallelly I am constantly and constintantly learned new skills and gained knowledge on Entrepreneurship by doing online courses, lsitening to entreprenership related podcast, interviews and other resources. Also  learned new frameworks  to develop my SaaS applications. My past knowledge on full stack web development in java gained me to connect the dots and learn these quickly.

Having working on Initial stages of bring up the idea up from the ground and learning skills needed to do that, the need to think for the long term also interested me to get MBA education. It is not my goal to simply launch a venture with no long term goals and benefits but i am determined and envisioned to make my venture long last and provide huge value and impact top people, indian economy, world economy, me and my family.
When I get into GSB, I will be in the process of my new venture and I fully intend to integrate the GSB experience into my venture and vice versa.
